# Sage2-Roll
##Rocks Roll for UIC/EVL's Sage2 software, provides the needed dependencies to run the Sage2 server as well as the server software itself.  
Description from a paper on Sage2 (taken from the [Sage2](http://sage2.sagecommons.org/project/publications/) website):
>Current web-based collaboration systems, such as
>Google Hangouts, WebEx, and Skype, primarily enable single
>users to work with remote collaborators through video
>conferencing and desktop mirroring. The original SAGE
>software, developed in 2004 and adopted at over one hundred
>international sites, was designed to enable groups to work in
>front of large shared displays in order to solve problems that
>required juxtaposing large volumes of information in ultra highresolution.
>We have developed SAGE2, as a complete redesign
>and implementation of SAGE, using cloud-based and web
>browser technologies in order to enhance data intensive colocated
>and remote collaboration.
